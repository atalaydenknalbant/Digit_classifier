# Digit_classifier

## Image classifier for the SVHN dataset
A neural network project that classifies real-world images digits.

## Dataset
* 10 classes, 1 for each digit. Digit '1' has label 1, '9' has label 9 and '0' has label 10.
* 73257 digits for training, 26032 digits for testing, and 531131 additional, somewhat less difficult samples, to use as extra training data
* Comes in two formats:
1. Original images with character level bounding boxes.
2. MNIST-like 32-by-32 images centered around a single character (many of the images do contain some distractors at the sides).
